# Design Patterns

**Note: All descriptions are provided without warranty.**

## Behavioural Patterns
- **Iterator**
  - Description: Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying structure.
- **Observer**
  - Description: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy**
  - Description: Enables a family of algorithms to be defined, encapsulated, and interchangeable at runtime, allowing the client to choose the desired algorithm.

## Creational Patterns
- **Builder**
  - Description: Separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Factory**
  - Description: Provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.
- **Singleton**
  - Description: Ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global point of access to it.

## Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**
  - Description: Converts the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect, allowing classes to work together that couldn't otherwise due to incompatible interfaces.
- **Decorator**
  - Description: Adds behavior to an object dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects of the same class.
- **Facade**
  - Description: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use and reducing dependencies.

## Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces
- Description: Demonstrates the difference between abstract classes and interfaces, which are used for defining contracts and providing common behavior in object-oriented programming.
